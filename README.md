# Inventory/Stock Management System

This web-based app is designed to manage stocks for individual companies and organizations and also handle the sale and purchase of their products. The stock management system includes different modules and features for adding, editing, viewing, and deleting items in the system database.

Usually, the manual stock management method run with pen and paper is not only labor-intensive but also time-consuming. This approach lacks a proper data organization structure, which can give rise to many risks associated with data mismanagement. This stock management project is a more efficient and improved approach to stock data management. It is much more secure and reliable than the manual method.

# Scope

In the application, the login page makes entry to the system module. The Admin can use this entry to log in to the system module through a valid user ID and password. Once logged in, the Admin can control these features: 

* Enter stock
* View stock
* Dispatch stock
* Move stock

The Admin can update and monitor all necessary information associated with stock management, including category, customer details, stock details, stock purchase, stock sales, stock entries, supplier details.

## How it works
When you register to the app (https://sirs-inventory.herokuapp.com) it registers you as an admin or the owner automatically, so its the admin that will assign roles to other users. So its depend the role you are been assigned to will determine what you are to do on the app. 

If you are assigned to a role of an admin or the owner of the app you will be able to do everything the app does. Its the role of the admin to firstly create the details of all their suppliers they make purchase of products from, so when making a purchase of a product its is also his role the take the details of the product he his purchasing so as to have the records for stocks. 
 
After making a purchase of a product it saves to the Items/Sales, it from there you can make sale of the products. Before making any sale its the role of the admin to create the details of the customer so as to have the records of each customer you make sales to. 

Then the admin can now make sale for the customer, when making sale for the customer he is going to create the details of the sale so as to also have the records of the stock he is making sale from.
